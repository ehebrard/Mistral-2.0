To use Mistral-2.0 as a flatzinc solver: 

1- Mistral-2.0/fz should be in the $PATH 
2- Compile the code (from within the folder Mistral-2.0) with:

$ make

This will generate the executable file fzn-mistral in the 'bin' folder.

3- You can test a flatzinc instance with

$ fz/mistral-fz data/zinc/zebra.fzn 

The option "-a" can be used to print all solutions.

4- Mistral-2.0 implements a simple form of parallelism. To build the parallel solver, first clean the binaries in fz (i.e. by running "$ make clean" in fz/), then compile (within fz/) with:

$ make parallel 

The option '-p $n' can be passed to fz/mistral-fz to indicate $n available logical cores.


5- Notes:
*/ Search annotations are not (yet) supported. So with or without the option -f, the solver will ignore them.
*/ The fz/mzn-lib/ directory contains some solver-specific definitions of global constraints from the MiniZinc library. When generating fzn instances, please use the option "-I fz/mzn"
*/ To install Mistral-2.0 within the Minizinc challenge virtual machine, just run fz/installVM.sh
